## Auto-installer

Auto-installer is based on ansible.
It was tested on Ubuntu 16.x and 17.x.
You need to run one command to install and configure everything.
Run it as root or a sudo enabled user.

./install-all.sh
```

## Local development with vagrant

If you want to test locally this version, you can install the app in a VM using virtualbox & vagrant.

Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Familiarize yourself with ansible/Vagrantfile to see the ports that are redirected.

```
cd ansible
vagrant up
ssh-add ansible/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts ansible/play_main.yml
```
